I want to implement a LADSPA version of the 2D and 3D reverb models I
developed with Jon.  But I'd better try walking before flying: a simple gain
control with a range of +/-120 dB and a mute button would be a good starting
point.

OK, enhanced gain control (mono and stereo) done, but only by basing heavily
on existing code, and even then I had a fair number of segfaults!  C is
perhaps not the right language to be writing DSP in.

I now have a mono and stereo gain, a pan (mono in, stereo out) and balance (stereo in, stereo out).  Also a partially implemented level meter plugin (only with peak and trough levels per 
LADSPA buffer at the moment; to add RMS level, crest factor, and tunable window size (should be at least 30 ms, probably)).
